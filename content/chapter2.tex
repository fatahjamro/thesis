\chapter{Literature}

One of the most important parts of a thesis is an overview of work done by
others.
This gives the reader confidence that you are speaking from a knowledgable
position, that you have done your hoemwork on the subject.
You should not just list out a bunch of papers you have found in journals.
Rather, you need to find the most relevant papers, describe their main results
and how they relate to your work, and also give a brief critique of the work if
necessary.


\section{Sources}
The sources of information you use are important too.
You'll need to use the academic literature, but you'll also likely need to use
technical specifications and other non-academic sources of literature.
They should all be referenced.
See the \texttt{bibliography.bib} file for information about referencing.
