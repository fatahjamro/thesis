Look at my nice program in Listing \ref{code:tuesday}.

\lipsum[29]

\begin{listing}[ht]
  \begin{minted}{python}
# Ian McLoughlin, 2018-02-01
# Is it Tuesday?

import datetime

if datetime.datetime.today().weekday() == 1:
  print("Yay! It is Tuesday.")
else:
  print("Unfortunately it is not Tuesday.")
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Is it Tuesday?}
